# 🗺️ TankWorld Roadmap

## **Short-Term**

* Clean up core simulation and rendering
* Improve the algorithm genome structure
* Solidify evolution logic (mutation, crossover, selection)
* Add clear metrics for agent performance

## **Mid-Term**

* Add more task modules beyond poker
* Expose all tunable parameters as part of the genome
* Improve the frontend so evolution is easy to watch
* Enhanced statistics and visualization for algorithm performance

## **Coding-Agent Layer (Layer 2 Evolution)**

* ✅ Let an automated coding agent analyze results (COMPLETED - see AI Code Evolution Workflow)
* ✅ Have it rewrite or refactor algorithm modules (COMPLETED - proven with FreezeResponse improvement)
* Feed those updated modules into the next evolution cycle (IN PROGRESS)
* Automate the full loop: Evolve → Analyze → Rewrite → Deploy → Evolve Again

## **Long-Term**

* Expand to real scientific or industrial problem domains
* Add distributed-compute support so users can run TankWorld workloads while watching the simulation
* Build a platform where the entertainment value drives compute contribution
* Scale to multiple interconnected tanks running different evolutionary experiments
* Enable cross-tank algorithm migration and competition

**Current Status:** Layer 1 evolution is fully functional with 58 algorithms. Layer 2 (AI code evolution) has proven successful with automated algorithm improvements. Next step: close the loop with automated deployment and continuous evolution.

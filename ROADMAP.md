# Tank World Roadmap

> **Vision**: A framework for AI-driven automated Artificial Life research, where entertaining visualizations drive real scientific discovery through two-layer evolution.

See [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md) for the full project vision.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Goal**: Establish the core simulation and AI evolution workflow.

### Completed
- [x] 58 parametrizable behavior algorithms across 6 categories
- [x] Layer 1 evolution: population-level natural selection
- [x] Fish tank visualization with fractal plants and predators
- [x] Headless mode for fast data collection (10-300x speedup)
- [x] AI code evolution agent (Layer 2 proof of concept)
- [x] Algorithm registry with source file mapping
- [x] LLM-friendly JSON stats export
- [x] Deterministic seeding for reproducibility
- [x] Poker minigame for energy redistribution

### In Progress
- [ ] Improve algorithm genome structure for better inheritance
- [ ] Add clear metrics for algorithm performance comparison
- [ ] Solidify mutation and selection logic

## Phase 2: Closed Loop

**Goal**: Fully automate the evolution cycle so it runs continuously without human intervention.

### Milestones
- [ ] **Automated validation**: Run test simulations before accepting AI changes
- [ ] **Regression detection**: Reject changes that reduce fitness metrics
- [ ] **Batch improvements**: AI improves multiple algorithms per cycle
- [ ] **Scheduled runs**: Nightly evolution cycles via CI/CD
- [ ] **Self-healing**: AI fixes broken code it generates
- [ ] **Metrics dashboard**: Track improvement velocity over time

### Success Criteria
- Evolution runs for 1 week without human intervention
- Fitness metrics measurably improve each cycle
- No regressions make it to main branch

## Phase 3: Research Platform

**Goal**: Make Tank World a legitimate platform for Alife research.

### Milestones
- [ ] **Experiment framework**: Configure and run named experiments
- [ ] **Complexity metrics**: Measure behavioral complexity, novelty, and diversity
- [ ] **Open-endedness detection**: Identify when evolution is genuinely open-ended
- [ ] **Cross-experiment analysis**: Compare results across parameter variations
- [ ] **Data export for publication**: Generate research-ready datasets
- [ ] **Reproducibility tools**: Exact replay of evolutionary history
- [ ] **Multiple task domains**: Beyond poker to other algorithmic challenges

### Success Criteria
- First Alife research paper using Tank World data
- Measurable open-ended evolution over extended runs
- Community contributions to algorithm library

## Phase 4: Distributed Compute

**Goal**: Users contribute compute by running entertaining simulations.

### Milestones
- [ ] **Multi-tank network**: Interconnected tanks sharing discoveries
- [ ] **Algorithm migration**: Successful algorithms spread across tanks
- [ ] **User engagement metrics**: Track what makes simulations entertaining
- [ ] **Compute contribution tracking**: Fair credit for participation
- [ ] **Browser-based client**: No installation required
- [ ] **Mobile visualization**: Watch evolution on any device

### Success Criteria
- 100+ simultaneous tanks running worldwide
- Algorithm improvements discovered across network
- Users run simulations because they're fun, not obligation

---

## Phase 5: Evolving Visualization

**Goal**: The AI evolves not just behaviors but the visualization itself.

### Milestones
- [ ] **Visualization abstraction**: Separate rendering from simulation logic
- [ ] **AI-proposed entities**: New entity types generated by AI
- [ ] **Engagement optimization**: Visualizations that maximize watch time
- [ ] **Alternative metaphors**: Beyond fish tanks to other visual systems
- [ ] **User preference learning**: Adapt visuals to what users enjoy

### Success Criteria
- AI successfully proposes new entity types
- Visualization changes improve user engagement metrics
- Multiple visualization "species" coexist

---

## Phase 6: Self-Improving Framework

**Goal**: The framework evolves its own architecture.

### Milestones
- [ ] **Meta-evolution**: AI improves the evolution system itself
- [ ] **Research question discovery**: AI proposes what to study next
- [ ] **Framework refactoring**: AI restructures codebase for new capabilities
- [ ] **Capability expansion**: System gains abilities humans didn't design

### Success Criteria
- AI proposes architectural changes that improve research output
- System complexity grows through AI evolution
- Emergent capabilities surprise developers

## Guiding Principles

1. **Interpretability**: Explicit algorithms over black-box neural networks
2. **Human oversight**: AI proposes, humans approve (at least in early phases)
3. **Data-driven**: All changes grounded in simulation evidence
4. **Entertainment value**: Visualization isn't optional—it drives participation

---

## Current Focus

**Next immediate steps:**
1. Close the automated loop (Phase 2)
2. Improve algorithm diversity tracking
3. Add more meaningful fitness metrics
4. Document successful AI improvements

Fix: MissingRNGError in poker benchmarks and update tests

- Fixed `MissingRNGError` in `core/poker/evaluation/benchmark_eval.py` by ensuring `create_standard_strategy` uses a deterministic seeded RNG for opponent initialization.
- Updated `create_standard_strategy` signature to accept `rng`.
- Updated `tests/test_benchmark_determinism.py` to pass seeded RNGs to strategies.
- Updated `tests/test_evolution_module.py` to resolve `MissingRNGError` regressions by passing explicit RNGs to all genetic operations (crossover, mutation, cloning).
- Verified that benchmarks and evolution tests now pass successfully.

This resolves the issue where `comprehensive_benchmark.py` was failing with "RNG required" errors during simulation.

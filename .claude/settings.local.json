This caused constant layout\nshifting and UI flickering.\n\nNow the component returns null when there''s no data, preventing any\nlayout shift. The leaderboard will only appear once fish have actually\nplayed poker games and have stats to display.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
